Nightmare's Weapon Addons!

64 New Weapons, Balanced (If you have Custom Shops Mod installed)
I highly recommend downloading Omegasis' Custom Shops Mod! It makes these weapons and obtaining them not cheaty. (Link Below)

HOW TO INSTALL

- Transfer .zip's Content to your Stardew Valley directory (\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley)
- Agree to replace the two files already existing (don't worry, it won't delete/replace anything else)
- That's it!

There's a backup included if you want to return to vanilla. Installation is the same.
If you prefer to install manually, just drag and drop the .xnb's to their correct folder *Make sure you do this correctly or game will crash!*

To obtain these weapons, you'll either need one of two mods:
- CJB's Item Spawner: 
http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/93/?

- Omegasis's Custom Shops:
https://github.com/janavarro95/Stardew_Valley_Mods

(Omegasis plans to upload his mod to either Nexus or Chucklefish forums, once he does, I'll update link)
Github is a bit confusing, here's what ya do to install it:

First Part
- Download ZIP (Top Right, it'll be a Master File including all his files)
- Extract/Move CustomShopMod_Redux_GUI to your \Stardew Valley\Mods folder

Second Part
- Extract/Move the CustomShopMod_Redux_GUI folder in !!!NightmaresWeapAddons.zip!!! into \Stardew Valley\Mods folder
- It will add my unique custom shop txt file and that's all. 
- In-Game, the default hotkey to open custom shop is 'U'

Everything should work fine now!

Both mods above do require SMAPI
